PgSQL Lib
==========

A library for helping interface with PostgreSQL.


## Roadmap
Upgrade to requiring PHP 8.1 in order to make the following changes:

* Change the Conjunction class to a simple enum.
* Replace usage of the PgSqlConnection object with the [PgSql\Connection class](https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.pgsql-connection.php).
